### Subscription Smart Contract

Our `Subscription.sol` contract manages user subscriptions with the following features:

- **Flexible Subscription Plans**: Weekly, monthly, and yearly options with different pricing tiers
- **Automatic Duration Management**: Extends existing subscriptions or creates new ones
- **Transparent Pricing**: All subscription costs are publicly visible on the blockchain
- **Owner Controls**: Allows for price updates and fund management by contract owner
- **Event Logging**: Emits events for subscriptions, price updates, and withdrawals for full transparency

```solidity
// Key functions include:
function subscribe(uint8 _plan) external payable;
function isSubscribed(address _user) external view returns (bool);
function updatePrices(uint256 _priceWeek, uint256 _priceMonth, uint256 _priceYear) external onlyOwner;
```
